# SPI_Master_Slave_System
## Author: Praveen Saravanan

# Description:
A SystemVerilog implementation of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol with master and slave controllers.

# SPI:
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals. This implementation provides a complete master-slave system with configurable parameters.

# SPI Signals:
SCLK: Serial Clock generated by master for synchronization
MOSI: Master Out Slave In - data transmission from master to slave
MISO: Master In Slave Out - data transmission from slave to master
CS_N: Chip Select (active low) - master selects target slave device

# Architecture
# SPI Master
The master module implements a finite state machine with three states: IDLE, TRANSFER, and DONE. It generates the SPI clock, controls chip select timing, and manages data transmission/reception through shift registers.

# Key Features for Master System:
Configurable data width (1-32 bits)
Adjustable clock divider for SPI frequency control
SPI Mode 0 support (CPOL=0, CPHA=0)
Automatic transfer completion detection

# SPI Slave:
The slave module responds to master-generated signals and handles bidirectional data transfer. It uses edge detection to synchronize with the external SPI clock and manages data through shift registers.

# Key Features for Slave System:
Automatic CS detection and reset
Edge-triggered data sampling and transmission
Parallel data interface for system integration
Transfer completion signaling

# Transfer Sequence:
Master asserts CS_N (low) to select slave
Master generates SCLK and transmits data on MOSI
Slave responds by transmitting data on MISO
After DATA_WIDTH bits, master deasserts CS_N
Transfer completion signaled via done flag
